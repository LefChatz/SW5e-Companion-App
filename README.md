# Star wars companion app
The idea is to create a Hub app with all the information contained in the SW5e version of D&D to enable players to quickly and easily access anything they might need during play or planning.
I have not contributed in any way in the creation of SW5e.
So far the app contains:
  An interactible list with all forcepowers with the ability to choose a forcepower to get all the related details, also a favourite option, and many sort/filter options.
  All the information surrounding Classes,Species,Backgrounds.
  An analogous to the first one list with all equipment
