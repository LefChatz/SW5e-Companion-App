        <item name="agent_1"> Many organizations active in the galaxy aren’t bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, mercenaries, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or items for use by the faction’s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don’t merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn’t necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction.\n\n"   "<b>Skill Proficiencies</b>: Choose two from Deception, Investigation, Lore, and Persuasion\n"   "<b>Languages</b>: Two of your choice\n"   "<b>Equipment</b>: Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 150 cr</item>

        <item name="agent_2Text">As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.</item>

You’re involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What’s more, you aren’t alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed.\n\nYou might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of street gangs. You might be a “velvet mask” bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn’t fit with the group’s objectives - but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions.\n\n"   "<b>Skill Proficiencies:</b> Choose two from Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth\n"   "<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> Your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer\;s kit\n"   "<b>Languages:</b> One of your choice\n"   "<b>Equipment:</b> A set of clothes appropriate to your duties, a set of binders, and a pouch containing 200 cr</item>
