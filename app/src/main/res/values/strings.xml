    <string name="berserkerinfo1"><font face="sans-serif">A massive wookiee hunter prowls through the forest, hefting his vibroaxe. With a roar he charges at the pair of trandoshans who dared poach his kin.\n"    "A gamorrean snarls at the latest challenger to his authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with his bare hands as he did to the last six rivals.\n"    "Frothing at the mouth, a nikto slams his helmet into the face of his foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.\n"    "These berserkers, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For every berserker, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.\n</font></string>
    <string name="berserkerinfo2Header">primal instinct</string>
    <string name="berserkerinfo2text">People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one\'s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a berserker, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Berserkers are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive where the civilized don\'t.\n"    "Berserkers come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A berserker can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.\n</string>
    <string name="berserkerinfo3Header">a life of danger</string>
    <string name="berserkerinfo3text">Not every person deemed "berserkers" by scions of civilized society has the berserker class. A true berserker among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Berserkers charge headlong into that danger so that their people don\'t have to.\n"    "Their courage in the face of danger makes berserkers perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a berserker. Some berserkers miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.\n</string>

Or is the campaign set in a rough-andtumble frontier where berserkers are common?\n"    "What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled planets by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to "civilized" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.\n\n</font><font size="24">quick build</font><font face="sans-serif">\nYou can make a berserker quickly by following these suggestions.

Monks harness this energy within themselves to create powerful effects and exceed their bodies\' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of focus in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of focus gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.\n</string>

    <string name="scoutinfo1"><font face="sans-serif">Rough and grizzled looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the quarry he knows is planning a raid on a nearby settlement. Clutching a techblade in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.\n"   " After tumbling away from the shrapnel of a missile\'s explosion, a bothan finds her feet and quick-fires two shots from her carbine at the oncoming tank.

They are adaptable, wielding both tech powers and their weaponry to overcome their foes.\n</font></string>
    <string name="scoutinfo2Header">Deadly Hunters</string>
    <string name="scoutinfo2text">Warriors in their own right, scouts specialize in tracking and hunting the monsters that threaten civilization— humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible Force-wielders, and renegade droids. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through any terrain and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Scouts focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.\n"   " Scouts acquire the ability to cast tech powers through utilization of a wristpad.

    <string name="scoutinfo3Header">independent Adventurers</string>
    <string name="scoutinfo3text">Though a scout might make a living as a bounty hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a scout\'s true calling is to defend civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in. In some places, scouts gather in secretive orders, though many scouts are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a rancor or a band of pirates attacks, a scout might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense. This fierce independence makes scouts well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, scouts respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization\'s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.\n</string>

At 3rd level, each class gains an archetype, or subclass, that helps that class focus in a specific direction or enable an entirely new playstyle, such as allowing raging in heavy armor for Juggernaut Approach berserkers or granting techcasting to Shield Specialist fighters. Each archetype grants additional features at higher levels, varying by class, as shown in the class table.\n"   " Additionally, each class has a second level of customization, such as a consular\'s Force-Empowered Casting or a scholar\'s Discoveries.

    <string name="bothan_example">Bothan Example</string>
    <string name="bothan_info1">Bothans are a short species of furry humanoids. Bothans are covered in fur which shifted in response to their emotional state by way of gentle ripplings. It is this trait, named Wrendui, that betrays them when members of their kind intend to be duplicitous in their dealings with others. They possess tapered pointed ears, and both males and females were known to sport beards.\n"   " Bothans are able to interbreed with the other species, though it is rare that they do so. Such hybrids somewhat resembled baseline humans with haunches, hooves, fur, pointed ears and a long tail.</string>
    <string name="bothan_info2">Bothan culture is guided by the philosophy and principles from the ancient text known as The Way, written by Golm Fervse\'dra. In this "Bothan Way", the pursuit of power and influence is paramount. Thus, individual bothans put their own political and economic success above all other concerns, and as a species, bothans put their own advancement ahead of other intergalactic interests. The volume of backstabbing, subtle character assassination and political maneuvering in bothan society is dizzying, and results in many species stereotyping bothans as untrustworthy. In fact, most bothans are habitually paranoid, believing that anyone who\'s not working with them, is working against them. In times of crisis, the focus of bothan society shifts to a survivalist state known as "ar\'krai". When engaged in ar\'krai, all fit bothans volunteer to defend their species from impending extinction.</string>
    <string name="bothan_info3">Male bothan names are often trickey while female\'s are soft. Surnames are familial.</string>

Their bodies also possess rapid healing abilities. These traits make them the perfect hand-to-hand specialists.\n"   " The Cathar species also has two subspecies, known as the Juhani and the Myr Rho. Both of these are notably less catlike than mainline Cathar. Cathar are born into a litter. The Cathar species is biologically similar to the Bothan species.</string>
    <string name="cathar_info2">On their homeworld, Cathar live in cities built into giant trees, and are organized into clans governed by elders. Stories of their great heroes were often carved into the trunks of these tree-homes for following generations to see. The Cathar mate for life, to the extent that when one mate dies, the survivor never has a relationship with another. Cathar clan society includes great pageants and celebrations, especially for their heroes. Their religion includes a ritual known as the "Blood Hunt," in which Cathar warriors individually engaged in combat against entire nests of Kiltik in order to gain honor and purge themselves of inner darkness. The native language of the Cathar is Catharese, which included the emphasis of some spoken words with a growl.</string>

    <string name="cerean_info1">The Cereans\' enlarged skulls, extending above their foreheads, house complex binary brains, provided with sufficient blood by an extra heart in their heads. The binary structure of Cerean thinking helps them to ponder two sides of an issue at once. It also enables them to process information and solve problems rapidly and provides a highly advanced capacity for concentration and meditation. Because of their thoughtful nature, they tend to be calm, rational and analytical, preferring peaceful philosophies and a lifestyle which works in harmony with nature. Though the quick-thinking Cereans have equally quick reflexes, they are commonly not as well coordinated as humans.</string>
    <string name="cerean_info2">Cereans developed a low-tech society on their homeworld and prefer to live in isolation from the wider galaxy. Preserving the natural beauty of Cerea, the planet is home to many Outsider Citadels where it is permissible to use offworld technology, though it could not be removed from the Citadel. Meditation is a core part of a Cerean\'s daily rituals, with many employing specially-forged kasha crystals as a focusing tool. By focusing one\'s thoughts while in contact with such crystals, distractions are eliminated, creating an exceptional meditation environment. Cerean Jedi sometimes incorporate these crystals into their lightsabers, providing great focus, even during intense physical combat.</string>

    <string name="chiss_info1">The chiss are a near-human species distinguished by their blue skin and glowing red eyes. Genetic analysis indicate that they are an offshoot of humanity, and it is believed that moving underground led to a divergence between them and baseline Humans. Their blue skin, jet black hair and red eyes generally command attention; these features make them physically striking and instantly recognizable.</string>
    <string name="chiss_info2">Chiss society is highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being enforced by a group of four affiliations known as the Ruling Families: the Csapla, Nuruodo, Inrokini and Sabosen. These are not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their government. Every chiss claims affiliation to one of the four families, as determined by both tradition and place of birth. The family names are more of a cultural holdover; the bloodlines had grown so co-meddled that any chiss could claim affiliation to any of the ruling families. In spite of the outward impression of calm and order that the chiss like to project to outsiders, there were evidently tensions within the Families; political assassinations are a real part of chiss political life for the Ruling Families.</string>
    <string name="chiss_info3">A chiss true-name has 3 parts, each separated by an apostrophe. The first part is their family name, the second part is their root name, and the third part is their occupation. Chiss rarely share their true-name with non-chiss, and usually go by their root name.

    <string name="devaronian_example">Devaronian Example</string>
    <string name="devaronian_info1">A bipedal mammalian species, Devaronians evolved in the dense jungles of Devaron as a hunter-gather species. Their bodies are denser than most humanoids\' and as a result they were heavier than their appearance would tend to indicate. Devaronians have silver-based blood, which appears thick and black when exposed. They possess a unique blood filtration and cleansing system which processes through two livers. Because their bodies are constantly cleansed of toxins and carcinogens, the species is highly resistant to poison. To this end, sulfur is used as a stimulant on Devaron to enhance speed and strength, because inhaling it causes the substance to enter the bloodstream rapidly. Their livers struggle to eliminate sulfur from their system, meaning that long-term use can be dangerous.</string>
    <string name="devaronian_info2">Devaronian males are driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another; they are often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. Female Devaronians, on the other hand, are content to remain in a single location, raising the young and running the government of Devaron. The males send money back to their homeworld to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever return. The females are content with this arrangement, as they tend to view the restless males as disruptive to home life.</string>

    <string name="duros_info1">The duros are humanoids with smooth blue-green skin, red eyes, lipless mouths, long thin noseless faces and green blood. Olfactory organs beneath their eyes are responsible for their sense of smell. Both females and males are bald, though both genders are easily distinguished. Their large red goggle-like eyes have slit pupils. Duros females lay eggs as they are descended from ancient reptiles, and they are born in a larval grub stage. Unlike similar species, the duros take care of their offspring from birth.</string>
    <string name="duros_info2">Their home planet Duro is primarily uninhabited due to massive pollution on the world over time. Instead, it is covered with automated farms for food production. The duros live in twenty orbital space cities above the planet.\n"   " The duros also established a vast, grand starship construction industry in the Duro system. The duros set up their government around a consortium of starship construction corporations, with all important political decisions made by the stockholders of the corporations. This meant that any duros that held stock in a company could participate in the administration of the system.\n"   " With their strong memories, some duros also choose to become extraordinary storytellers, renowned galaxy-wide for their ability to learn a wide range of narratives by heart, and perform them all with stunning accuracy.</string>

    <string name="ewok_info1">Ewoks are sentient humanoid mammals, averaging about one meter in height, which can provide an advantage when trying to hide. They are covered in fur from head to toe, with brown and black the most common colors. Other Ewoks have near-white or reddish fur, but red fur is supposedly the rarest shade an Ewok can get. Most Ewoks have solid-colored fur, though a few sport stripes. Ewoks have large, bright eyes, small humanoid noses, and hands that possess two fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite their small size, Ewoks are physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained Humans. Their appearance has been likened to "little bears," though they are sometimes referred to as "mini Wookiees."</string>
    <string name="ewok_info2">Most Ewoks live high among the trees of the forest moon, in villages built between the closely spaced trees. The basic design of a tree village has a "Central Village" of thatched-roof huts on the primary limbs. These huts are high enough above the ground to be out of reach of predators. Suspended bridges connect the gaps between trees, adjoining distant huts. Knotted rope ladders allow access up or down.\n"   " Ewoks enjoy singing and playing music during celebrations and rituals. They are resourceful and tend to make use of everything they get their hands on; they use a variety of crude drums, horns, flutes, and other instruments in their music.</string>

    <string name="gamorrean_info1">Although a typical gamorrean is squat, green, and heavily built, not all shared these characteristics. Most gamorreans have a dark greenish coloration over a large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration does vary, particularly among females, with light skinned and two-toned pigmentation not uncommon. Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white pigmentation are possible. Males tended to have less skin variation and had a greater tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varied evenly between gold-yellow, blue, black and brown. The gamorreans generally put no importance on skin or eye coloration although there were some superstitions linked to certain markings.</string>
    <string name="gamorrean_info2">Gamorreans are organized into clans ruled by a male warlord and his wife, who was the most powerful of the clan matrons. While the warlord and his boars are solely concerned with preparing and participating in battle with rival clans, the matrons of the clan performed all the productive work including farming, hunting, manufacturing, and running businesses. Since the amount of available arable land on Gamorr is scarce, clans often lay claim to the same piece of land, and they spend their time fighting over possession.</string>
    <string name="gamorrean_info3">Gamorrean names are very gutteral and rough. Male names are typically one syllable while females are two. Surnames are based on clan affiliation rather than family.</string>

    <string name="gungan_example">Gungan Example</string>
    <string name="gungan_info1">Starting life as tadpoles, Gungans develop into tall beings with extremely flexible cartilaginous skeletons. Strong leg muscles allow for powerful and quick frogkick style swimming through water as well as a remarkable jumping ability while on land. Fin-like ears (called haillu) also aid them in swimming, as well as expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and fear. They have partially retractable eyestalks with nictitating membranes when underwater. Green eyes are unusual amongst Gungans.</string>
    <string name="gungan_info2">Gungans are generally a generous and peaceful species. They truly love to have visitors and warmly welcome them; however, they would remain suspicious until the visitors have earned their respect. Gungans are not tolerant of anyone who threatens their peaceful culture. They have very strict laws, and will go to the extremes to punish anyone who has committed a minor crime. Vandals, for example, can be given a sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning.\n"   " If a Gungan is cast out of society, it is very difficult for them to return. If they do manage to return legally, they are often subjected to heavy discrimination. This can make life very difficult for them and can go on for months or years, until their past offenses disappear from memory. Returning back to the settlement they were exiled from illegally will sometimes result in the death penalty, especially if they brought along outsiders.</string>

They come in two sexes, male and female, and give birth to live young. They are bipedal beings with a bilateral symmetry, having a front and a back end, as well as an upside and downside. Their bodies are comprised of a torso with a head and four limbs attached to it. The upper limbs, or arms, end in hands which had five fingers each; the lower ones, called legs, end in feet. The human fingers have multiple points of articulation, and one of them is an opposable thumb that allowed for fine manipulation. Finally, they have one head perched atop their torso. Many other species, including twi\'leks, mon calamari, or zabraks, are referred to as "humanoids" because of their structural resemblance to humans.</string>
    <string name="human_info2">Humans can occupy a variety of employs, from politicians to bounty hunters, swoop racers, smugglers, or even a farmer.

Despite this fact, most Ithorians go their entire lives without ever resorting to violence, and so the ability remained relatively ambiguous.</string>

They are generally devoted environmentalists, staunch herbivores, and complete pacifists, devoting much time to contemplating their ecology, studying plants and their uses and the overall respecting of all living things. Most Ithorians never set foot on their own planet, instead living in floating cities above their world called herdships. Only three of their continents have been explored and harvested, the other two never having been touched by Ithorian hands. They demonstrate extreme belief in the protection and sustaining of their environment as dictated by their "Law of Life."</string>

Underneath their robes, jawas appear to be gaunt, rodent-like creatures, with shrunken faces and yellow eyes.</string>
    <string name="jawa_info2">Jawas are a communal, compulsive scavenger species who spend most of their life devoted to scavenging the deserts of Tatooine in search of any scrap metal, droid or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star travel and technological advancement. Most non-jawas regard the jawas as scavengers and thieves, a description that most jawas actually find pleasing.\n"   " The jawa\'s unofficial motto is not to look for uses in a salvaged item, but rather to imagine someone else who might find a use for it. This is evidenced in their endless search for wares with which to trade with almost any being jawas encounter. They have a kind of instinctive feel for machinery and electronics, notorious for knowing how to get a piece of equipment functioning just well enough to sell.</string>

An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerge from their egg as a tadpole that develops arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs are weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood.</string>

They possess distinctive faces: large, round, multifaceted eyes; tapir-like snouts; and a pair of saucer-shaped antennae on their heads, which served to detect vibrations. The flexible snouts augmented the rodians\' finely tuned olfactory senses, collecting and filtering the air. Their characteristically large eyes indicated a primarily nocturnal ancestry and were capable of seeing into the infrared part of the spectrum. Due to their love of fighting and active lifestyles, most rodians kept in good condition, normally lean and wiry; however, some wealthy rodians became complacent and obese.</string>
    <string name="rodian_info2">Rodian culture is obsessed with violence and death, due to behaviors and practices that are ingrained since their earliest ancestry. Their densely packed jungle homeworld is ill-suited for agriculture, requiring rodians to compete with vicious predators for most of their food, some of which can wipe out entire rodian villages. As the rodians developed cunning hunting tactics to survive, the hunt became central to their culture. Eventually, having driven most of the other predators on the planet to near extinction, they began to hunt each other in various wars and gladiatorial contests.</string>

    <string name="sith_pureblood_info2">Sith culture is a rigid and stratified caste-based society. For the sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Though they are in an almost constant state of war, their civilization is quite sophisticated; they see these acts not as cruel or barbaric, but simply basic aspects of existence. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society.</string>
    <string name="sith_pureblood_info3">Sith pureblood names are not conventional. They are often named for virtues in the Sith tongue. Sith rarely share surnames, since they do not value family ties. When a sith pureblood achieves a success or victory, they often change their name to match their perceived newfound status. Since Force-sensitivity is common in sith purebloods, and their culture is built around strength, most sith are called simply "My Lord," or some other epithet, by their underlings.</string>

The pattern of stripes varies from individual to individual. This red and white pattern was a phenotype left over from their ancestor\'s camouflage that helped them to blend in with Shili\'s natural surroundings.\n"   " Their heads bear two montrals, with three to four head-tails, whose stripes were darker than those of the montrals. Togruta have the ability to sense the proximity and movement of physical objects around them by means of their hollow montrals, which detect space ultrasonically.

    <string name="trandoshan_info1">Trandoshans are a large, bipedal sentient species, with scaly skin which was shed roughly once every standard year and was thought to be very durable. Cold-blooded reptiles, trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a trandoshan\'s finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward.</string>
    <string name="trandoshan_info2">Trandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper, whom they would appease through acts which increased their Jagannath points. This is done by living a lifestyle which was, by non-trandoshan standards, overtly aggressive, leading many trandoshans to become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers. Trandoshans especially prize wookiee pelts, which consequently play a large part in earning Jagannath points-capturing the pelts of particularly infamous wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in Jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one\'s Jagganath points-effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper. They could, however, win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed their score.</string>
    <string name="trandoshan_info3">Trandoshan names are quite harsh and contain a lot of elongated sounds, as well as a lot of s\'s. Differences between male and female names are often very subtle, but there is a higher chance for female names to contain softer sounds.</string>

From birth, Tuskens are covered in wraps, and, barring very rare occasions, will not bare any part of their skin in sight of another person. This, combined with their hostility to outsiders and Tatooine\'s remote and arid nature, makes even study of Tusken corpses difficult.</string>
    <string name="tusken_info2">Tuskens are a primative, tribal race, mostly living in small clans scattered throughout Tatooine\'s deserts. Due to the harsh and unforgiving desert environment, Tusken clans are often xenophobic and territorial, but it is not unknown for them to adopt members of other species into the clan. They believe that all water is sacred and promised to them alone, and are infamous among the other residents of Tatooine for raiding and pillaging settlements and farms.\n"   " Tusken clans are usually very stratified, with males as hunters and warriors, while females and children maintain the camp. Tusken warriors hold their bond with their gaderffii weapons and Bantha mounts as sacred, and will choose death before relinquishing either.</string>

    <string name="twilek_info1">Twi\'leks are usually thin, although corpulent individuals were known to exist. Twi\'leks are omnivores; this diet is essential given that food is scarce on their homeworld, Ryloth. Twi\'leks possess multiple stomachs, an unusual trait that enables them to eat almost any food. When traveling off their homeworld, twi\'leks rarely refuse food, which frequently leads to obesity among starfarers. Twi\'lek society also considers obesity as a sign of influence and success.</string>
    <string name="twilek_info2">The natural grace and exotic beauty of the female twi\'leks make them a popular target among slave traders. Slavery is the main currency of Ryloth. Some see it as a chance to make money by kidnapping or selling orphaned children, while others see slavery as a way of saving children from growing up in Ryloth\'s harsh environment. A number of twi\'leks believe that slavery is an efficient way to proliferate their species and preserve their culture, as the twi\'leks lack their own means of inter-planetary travel. Regardless of how it came about, many twi\'leks live as slaves or entertainers and are considered status symbols, especially the females of rarer skin hues.

    <string name="weequay_example">Weequay Example</string>
    <string name="weequay_info1">Weequays are humanoids with thick, leathery skin that ranges in color from tan to dark brown. Their faces are lipless, with a frill along each of their jowls.</string>
    <string name="weequay_info2">Weequays have the ability to communicate with members of their own clan through smell by exuding complex pheromones. This pheromonal language can not be understood by any other species, or even by Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses can even tell that two Weequay are communicating. Since each Weequay\'s pheromones are unique, Weequay have no need for a name within their clan. As a result, speech is only a secondary form of communication for Weequay, and they seldom speak a whole sentence, resulting in Humans mistakenly believing the species to be unintelligent.\n"   " Male Weequay often tie their hair into a long braid each year spent away from their homeworld as a tribute to their home. When they returned, they shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutts were often very close to their homeworld, and would only have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually bald, and did not follow this tradition.</string>
    <string name="weequay_info3">Only Weequay who have to live among other clans, or among non-Weequay, take a personal name. Even then, some are simply referred to as "Weequay". In Weequay culture, individual identity is much less important than the clan. As long as the clan survives, a single Weequay is expendable. This results in a sometimes brutal culture.</string>

    <!--Wookie-->
    <string name="wookie">WooKiE</string>
    <string name="wookie_example">Wookie Example</string>
    <string name="wookie_info1">Wookiees are a tall species of furry giants from the planet Kashyyyk, who can grow to a height of over eight feet. They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably came in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species has two sexes, female and male. The latter grows long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye colors are usually blue, green, yellow, golden, brown, or red.</string>
    <string name="wookie_info2">Wookiees greatly value honor and loyalty. Therefore, their notion of "family" encompassed much more than just blood ties. A part of that most sacred tradition was the social institution of life debt: when a wookiee\'s life was saved by someone else, regardless of the species, they would frequently devote themselves to a lifetime of service to their savior and their family. Through the mechanism of the life debt, the People of the Trees used to develop unbreakable bonds with their boon companions and true friends, forming a "honor family."</string>
    <string name="wookie_info3">Wookiee names are diverse; some names are simple and short while others are long and complicated. The majority of names often have softer big sounds and more melodic tones to them. Since offworlders have trouble using wookiees\' real names, they often adopt simpler nicknames to go by.</string>

    <!--Zabrak-->
    <string name="zabrak">zABXAK</string>
    <string name="zabrak_example">Zabrak Example</string>
    <string name="zabrak_info1">Zabrak are near-human, but have a number of significant physical characteristics that set them apart from baseline Humanity. The most striking of these are a series of vestigial horns that crown the heads of both males and females. These horns grow at puberty in varying patterns and signified that their rite of passage is drawing near.\n"   " In addition to their horns, another of the traits that make zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial tattoos, which are made up of thin lines received during their rite of passage. These could symbolize many things, including but not limited to family lineage, place of birth, or even a design that reflected their individual personalities.\n"   " Lastly, zabraks possess a second heart.</string>
    <string name="zabrak_info2">Zabrak are often seen by most other species as being single-minded, an observation that is not terribly incorrect. This single-minded determination comes from the fact that they are a species with a strong sense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able to accomplish any task that they set out to do. However, this does not lead a zabrak to develop a sense of prideful superiority towards others. Though it is not uncommon to see competition between colonies, this is not seen as a negative. The zabraks believe that the various experiences of the different colonies only serve to add to the species\' overall value throughout the galaxy.</string>
    <string name="zabrak_info3">Zabrak names are usually derived from the animals living on their planet. Zabraks don\'t use surnames.</string>
