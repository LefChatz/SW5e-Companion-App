It\'s more than a profession; it\'s your character\'s calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the galaxy. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A consular, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant of the Force. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the consular might know a number of Jedi or Sith who share his faith.\n"   " Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter\'s mastery of weapons and armor, and an engineer\'s powers.

Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, as well as a detailed explanation of each one. At 3rd level, each class gains an archetype, or subclass, that helps that class focus in a specific direction or enable an entirely new playstyle, such as allowing raging in heavy armor for Juggernaut Approach berserkers or granting techcasting to Shield Specialist fighters. Each archetype grants additional features at higher levels, varying by class, as shown in the class table.\n"   " Additionally, each class has a second level of customization, such as a consular\'s Force-Empowered Casting or a scholar\'s Discoveries. The level at which each class obtains this second level varies. If a class\'s customization requires a level, that refers to class level. If a customization has prerequisites, the character must meet them to learn it. A character can learn a customization at the same time it meets the customization\'s prerequisites.

        <font size="22">\nAge</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nThe age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species\' expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.\n</font>
        <font size="22">\nAlignment</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nMost species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your sith pureblood follows the light side, for example, in defiance of the Sith Empire can help you better define your character.\n</font>
        <font size="22">\nSize</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nCharacters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons and heavy shields, as explained in chapter 6.\n</font>
        <font size="22">\nSpeed</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nYour speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).\n</font>
        <font size="22">\nLanguages</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nBy virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Each species typically speaks, or at least understands, Galactic Basic as well as having a unique language of their own. Chapter 4 lists the most common languages of the Star Wars universe.</font></string>
    <!--Bith-->
    <string name="bith">BiTH</string>
    <string name="bith_example">Bith Example</string>
    <string name="bith_info1">Bith are craniopods with pale pink, yellow, or green skin, large heads, large lidless eyes, toe less feet, and long fingers. Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The bith\'s internal systems are different from most humanoids, as the bith have only one lung, and exhale through their skin. Bith also lack a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin-flaps of their cheeks.\n"   " The other bith senses are also acute. Bith can sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other species sensed colors. Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun\'s, can see microscopic details of nearby objects, but are extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors is the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It is described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, bith have high manual dexterity which helps them manipulate fine tools, though their physical prowess with gross motor skills was only average.</string>
    <string name="bith_info2">Bith are one of the galaxy\'s most ancient civilizations, with a history going back millions of years. This antiquity garners respect in certain quarters, such as among the Gree, who gave them more respect than other, "younger" species. Their society is highly regimented, with everything from mate selection to political leadership controlled by sophisticated computer programs.</string>
    <string name="bith_info3">Bith names are quite diverse. Some names look complicated and difficult to pronounce, while others are quite simple.</string>
    <string name="bith_traitsHeader">Bith Traits</string>
    <string name="bith_traitsText">As a bith, you have the following special traits.\n"   " <b>Ability Score Increase</b>.

Whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check related to computers, you are considered to have expertise in the Technology skill.\n"   " <b>Sonic Sensitivity</b>. Your powerful sense of hearing makes you especially vulnerable to deafening sounds. You have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal sonic damage (explained in chapter 9).\n"   " <b>Trance</b>. You only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits.\n"   " <b>Languages</b>.

    <!--Bothan-->
    <string name="bothan">BoTHAN</string>
    <string name="bothan_example">Bothan Example</string>
    <string name="bothan_info1">Bothans are a short species of furry humanoids. Bothans are covered in fur which shifted in response to their emotional state by way of gentle ripplings. It is this trait, named Wrendui, that betrays them when members of their kind intend to be duplicitous in their dealings with others. They possess tapered pointed ears, and both males and females were known to sport beards.\n"   " Bothans are able to interbreed with the other species, though it is rare that they do so. Such hybrids somewhat resembled baseline humans with haunches, hooves, fur, pointed ears and a long tail.</string>
    <string name="bothan_info2">Bothan culture is guided by the philosophy and principles from the ancient text known as The Way, written by Golm Fervse\'dra. In this "Bothan Way", the pursuit of power and influence is paramount. Thus, individual bothans put their own political and economic success above all other concerns, and as a species, bothans put their own advancement ahead of other intergalactic interests. The volume of backstabbing, subtle character assassination and political maneuvering in bothan society is dizzying, and results in many species stereotyping bothans as untrustworthy. In fact, most bothans are habitually paranoid, believing that anyone who\'s not working with them, is working against them. In times of crisis, the focus of bothan society shifts to a survivalist state known as "ar\'krai". When engaged in ar\'krai, all fit bothans volunteer to defend their species from impending extinction.</string>
    <string name="bothan_info3">Male bothan names are often trickey while female\'s are soft. Surnames are familial.</string>
    <string name="bothan_traitsHeader">Bothan Traits</string>
    <string name="bothan_traitsText">As a bothan, you have the following special traits.\n"   " <b>Ability Score Increase</b>. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.\n"   " <b>Age</b>. Bothans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\n"   " <b>Alignment</b>. Bothans\' duplicitous nature causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.\n"   " <b>Size</b>. Bothans stand 4–5 feet tall and weigh under 100 pounds. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\n"   " <b>Speed</b>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n"   " <b>Naturally Stealthy</b>. You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is your size or larger than you.\n"   " <b>Nimble Escape</b>. You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.</string>
    <string name="bothan_traitsTextBox">While bothans are suitable for many classes, they most iconically fit as operatives. The Nimble Escape special trait heavily overlaps with the operative\'s <b>Cunning Action</b> feature, however, making this species/class combination counterintuitive. If, during the character creation part of your game, a player decides to make a bothan operative, consider letting them use the following feature instead:\n"   " <b>Versatile Expertise</b>. You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice. You gain expertise in one skill of your choice in which you are proficient.</string>
    <string name="bothan_traitsText2">"   " <b>Shrewd</b>. You are proficient in the Insight and Deception skills.\n"   " <b>Languages</b>. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Bothese. Bothese had a great influence on the forming of Galactic Basic; the two languages share many cognates.</string>
    <!--Cathar-->
    <string name="cathar">cATHAX</string>
    <string name="cathar_example">Cathar Example</string>
    <string name="cathar_info1">The Cathar have fur-covered bodies with thick manes as well as prominent, retractable claws that can deliver powerful killing attacks on foes and prey. Their bodies also possess rapid healing abilities. These traits make them the perfect hand-to-hand specialists.\n"   " The Cathar species also has two subspecies, known as the Juhani and the Myr Rho. Both of these are notably less catlike than mainline Cathar. Cathar are born into a litter. The Cathar species is biologically similar to the Bothan species.</string>
    <string name="cathar_info2">On their homeworld, Cathar live in cities built into giant trees, and are organized into clans governed by elders. Stories of their great heroes were often carved into the trunks of these tree-homes for following generations to see. The Cathar mate for life, to the extent that when one mate dies, the survivor never has a relationship with another. Cathar clan society includes great pageants and celebrations, especially for their heroes. Their religion includes a ritual known as the "Blood Hunt," in which Cathar warriors individually engaged in combat against entire nests of Kiltik in order to gain honor and purge themselves of inner darkness. The native language of the Cathar is Catharese, which included the emphasis of some spoken words with a growl.</string>
    <string name="cathar_info3">Cathar names can sound both melodic and fairly gutteral, but they almost always sound strong and fierce. Female names are typically longer than male names. Surnames are usually one syllable.</string>
    <string name="cathar_traitsHeader">cathar Traits</string>
    <string name="cathar_traitsText">As a cathar, you have the following special traits.\n"   " <b>Ability Score Increase</b>.

You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n"   " <b>Leonine Agility</b>. Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.\n"   " <b>Silent Step</b>. You have proficiency in the Stealth skill.\n"   " <b>Treeclimber</b>. You have a climbing speed of 30 feet. You have advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve climbing.\n"   " <b>Languages</b>. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Catharese.</string>
    <!--Cerean-->
    <string name="cerean">cEXEAN</string>
    <string name="cerean_example">Cerean Example</string>
    <string name="cerean_info1">The Cereans\' enlarged skulls, extending above their foreheads, house complex binary brains, provided with sufficient blood by an extra heart in their heads. The binary structure of Cerean thinking helps them to ponder two sides of an issue at once. It also enables them to process information and solve problems rapidly and provides a highly advanced capacity for concentration and meditation. Because of their thoughtful nature, they tend to be calm, rational and analytical, preferring peaceful philosophies and a lifestyle which works in harmony with nature. Though the quick-thinking Cereans have equally quick reflexes, they are commonly not as well coordinated as humans.</string>
    <string name="cerean_info2">Cereans developed a low-tech society on their homeworld and prefer to live in isolation from the wider galaxy. Preserving the natural beauty of Cerea, the planet is home to many Outsider Citadels where it is permissible to use offworld technology, though it could not be removed from the Citadel. Meditation is a core part of a Cerean\'s daily rituals, with many employing specially-forged kasha crystals as a focusing tool. By focusing one\'s thoughts while in contact with such crystals, distractions are eliminated, creating an exceptional meditation environment. Cerean Jedi sometimes incorporate these crystals into their lightsabers, providing great focus, even during intense physical combat.</string>
    <string name="cerean_info3">Cerean male first names are often hyphenated, while females are not. Surnames are familial.</string>
    <string name="cerean_traitsHeader">cerean Traits</string>

When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\n"   " <b>Trance</b>.

Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits.\n"   " <b>Languages</b>. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Cerean. Cerean is characterized by its gravelly sounds.</string>
    <!--Chiss-->
    <string name="chiss">cHiSS</string>
    <string name="chiss_example">Chiss Example</string>
    <string name="chiss_info1">The chiss are a near-human species distinguished by their blue skin and glowing red eyes. Genetic analysis indicate that they are an offshoot of humanity, and it is believed that moving underground led to a divergence between them and baseline Humans. Their blue skin, jet black hair and red eyes generally command attention; these features make them physically striking and instantly recognizable.</string>
    <string name="chiss_info2">Chiss society is highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being enforced by a group of four affiliations known as the Ruling Families: the Csapla, Nuruodo, Inrokini and Sabosen. These are not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their government. Every chiss claims affiliation to one of the four families, as determined by both tradition and place of birth. The family names are more of a cultural holdover; the bloodlines had grown so co-meddled that any chiss could claim affiliation to any of the ruling families. In spite of the outward impression of calm and order that the chiss like to project to outsiders, there were evidently tensions within the Families; political assassinations are a real part of chiss political life for the Ruling Families.</string>
    <string name="chiss_info3">A chiss true-name has 3 parts, each separated by an apostrophe. The first part is their family name, the second part is their root name, and the third part is their occupation. Chiss rarely share their true-name with non-chiss, and usually go by their root name. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.\n"   "<b>Names:</b> Crorcu\'ecuk\'unist, Dash\'esoru\'ishur, Jerd\'ecer\'lonii, Kisk\'egauw\'eqhi, Marag\'aliphil\'eduo, Pommo\'icuote\'nlerme, Vornu\'wuzi\'lerdim</string>
    <string name="chiss_traitsHeader">chiss Traits</string>
    <string name="chiss_traitsText">As a chiss, you have the following special traits.\n"   " <b>Ability Score Increase</b>. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\n"   " <b>Age</b>. Chiss reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\n"   " <b>Alignment</b>. Chiss\' tactical and selfish nature cause them to tend toward lawful dark side, though there are exceptions.\n"   " <b>Size</b>. Chiss typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh about 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\n"   " <b>Speed</b>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n"   " <b>Martial Proficiency</b>. You have proficiency with light and medium armor as well as the heavy pistol and sniper rifle.\n"   " <b>Politically Minded</b>. You have proficiency in the Insight skill.\n"   " <b>Tech Resistance</b>. Growing up around technology leaves an impact on chiss. You have advantage on Dexterity and Intelligence saving throws against tech powers.\n"   " <b>Superior Darkvision</b>. Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n"   " <b>Languages</b>. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, Cheunh, and your choice of Minnisiat or Sy Bisti. Cheunh is a complex language that is difficult for nonchiss to learn. Chiss take pride in this difficulty. Communications with outsiders are conducted through local trade-languages like Minnisiat or Sy Bisti.</string>
    <!--Devaronian-->
    <string name="devaronian">DEvAXoNiAN</string>
    <string name="devaronian_example">Devaronian Example</string>
    <string name="devaronian_info1">A bipedal mammalian species, Devaronians evolved in the dense jungles of Devaron as a hunter-gather species. Their bodies are denser than most humanoids\' and as a result they were heavier than their appearance would tend to indicate. Devaronians have silver-based blood, which appears thick and black when exposed. They possess a unique blood filtration and cleansing system which processes through two livers. Because their bodies are constantly cleansed of toxins and carcinogens, the species is highly resistant to poison. To this end, sulfur is used as a stimulant on Devaron to enhance speed and strength, because inhaling it causes the substance to enter the bloodstream rapidly. Their livers struggle to eliminate sulfur from their system, meaning that long-term use can be dangerous.</string>
    <string name="devaronian_info2">Devaronian males are driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another; they are often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. Female Devaronians, on the other hand, are content to remain in a single location, raising the young and running the government of Devaron. The males send money back to their homeworld to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever return. The females are content with this arrangement, as they tend to view the restless males as disruptive to home life.</string>
    <string name="devaronian_info3">Devaronian names are dark, complex and often guttural, with some harsher tones mixed in here and there.</string>
    <string name="devaronian_traitsHeader">Devaronian Traits</string>
    <string name="devaronian_traitsText">As a devaronian, you have the following special traits.\n"   " <b>Ability Score Increase</b>. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\n"   " <b>Age</b>. Devaronians reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\n"   " <b>Alignment</b>. Devaronians\' greediness causes them to tend toward chaotic balanced, though there are exceptions.\n"   " <b>Size</b>. Devaronians typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh about 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\n"   " <b>Speed</b>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n"   " <b>Curiosity</b>. You have proficiency with Survival or Investigation (your choice).\n"   " <b>Heat Adaptation</b>. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme heat.\n"   " <b>Jungle Dweller</b>. Growing up in the jungles of Devaron has left an impact. You don’t treat jungle terrain as difficult terrain.\n"   " <b>Silver Tongue</b>. You have proficiency with Deception or Persuasion (your choice).\n"   " <b>Tech Resistance</b>. Growing up around technology leaves an impact on devaronians. You have advantage on Dexterity and Intelligence saving throws against tech powers.\n"   " <b>Two Livered</b>. Devaronians have two livers, which makes them adept at filtering toxins. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).\n<b>Languages</b>. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Devaronese. Devaronese is characterized by grunts and grumbles. It is rare to hear a Devaronian speak it anywhere other than their homeworld of Devaron.</string>

    <string name="duros_info1">The duros are humanoids with smooth blue-green skin, red eyes, lipless mouths, long thin noseless faces and green blood. Olfactory organs beneath their eyes are responsible for their sense of smell. Both females and males are bald, though both genders are easily distinguished. Their large red goggle-like eyes have slit pupils. Duros females lay eggs as they are descended from ancient reptiles, and they are born in a larval grub stage. Unlike similar species, the duros take care of their offspring from birth.</string>
    <string name="duros_info2">Their home planet Duro is primarily uninhabited due to massive pollution on the world over time. Instead, it is covered with automated farms for food production. The duros live in twenty orbital space cities above the planet.\n"   " The duros also established a vast, grand starship construction industry in the Duro system. The duros set up their government around a consortium of starship construction corporations, with all important political decisions made by the stockholders of the corporations. This meant that any duros that held stock in a company could participate in the administration of the system.\n"   " With their strong memories, some duros also choose to become extraordinary storytellers, renowned galaxy-wide for their ability to learn a wide range of narratives by heart, and perform them all with stunning accuracy.</string>

    <string name="ewok_info1">Ewoks are sentient humanoid mammals, averaging about one meter in height, which can provide an advantage when trying to hide. They are covered in fur from head to toe, with brown and black the most common colors. Other Ewoks have near-white or reddish fur, but red fur is supposedly the rarest shade an Ewok can get. Most Ewoks have solid-colored fur, though a few sport stripes. Ewoks have large, bright eyes, small humanoid noses, and hands that possess two fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite their small size, Ewoks are physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained Humans. Their appearance has been likened to "little bears," though they are sometimes referred to as "mini Wookiees."</string>
    <string name="ewok_info2">Most Ewoks live high among the trees of the forest moon, in villages built between the closely spaced trees. The basic design of a tree village has a "Central Village" of thatched-roof huts on the primary limbs. These huts are high enough above the ground to be out of reach of predators. Suspended bridges connect the gaps between trees, adjoining distant huts. Knotted rope ladders allow access up or down.\n"   " Ewoks enjoy singing and playing music during celebrations and rituals. They are resourceful and tend to make use of everything they get their hands on; they use a variety of crude drums, horns, flutes, and other instruments in their music.</string>

    <string name="gamorrean_info1">Although a typical gamorrean is squat, green, and heavily built, not all shared these characteristics. Most gamorreans have a dark greenish coloration over a large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration does vary, particularly among females, with light skinned and two-toned pigmentation not uncommon. Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white pigmentation are possible. Males tended to have less skin variation and had a greater tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varied evenly between gold-yellow, blue, black and brown. The gamorreans generally put no importance on skin or eye coloration although there were some superstitions linked to certain markings.</string>
    <string name="gamorrean_info2">Gamorreans are organized into clans ruled by a male warlord and his wife, who was the most powerful of the clan matrons. While the warlord and his boars are solely concerned with preparing and participating in battle with rival clans, the matrons of the clan performed all the productive work including farming, hunting, manufacturing, and running businesses. Since the amount of available arable land on Gamorr is scarce, clans often lay claim to the same piece of land, and they spend their time fighting over possession.</string>
    <string name="gamorrean_info3">Gamorrean names are very gutteral and rough. Male names are typically one syllable while females are two. Surnames are based on clan affiliation rather than family.</string>

    <string name="gungan_example">Gungan Example</string>
    <string name="gungan_info1">Starting life as tadpoles, Gungans develop into tall beings with extremely flexible cartilaginous skeletons. Strong leg muscles allow for powerful and quick frogkick style swimming through water as well as a remarkable jumping ability while on land. Fin-like ears (called haillu) also aid them in swimming, as well as expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and fear. They have partially retractable eyestalks with nictitating membranes when underwater. Green eyes are unusual amongst Gungans.</string>
    <string name="gungan_info2">Gungans are generally a generous and peaceful species. They truly love to have visitors and warmly welcome them; however, they would remain suspicious until the visitors have earned their respect. Gungans are not tolerant of anyone who threatens their peaceful culture. They have very strict laws, and will go to the extremes to punish anyone who has committed a minor crime. Vandals, for example, can be given a sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning.\n"   " If a Gungan is cast out of society, it is very difficult for them to return. If they do manage to return legally, they are often subjected to heavy discrimination. This can make life very difficult for them and can go on for months or years, until their past offenses disappear from memory. Returning back to the settlement they were exiled from illegally will sometimes result in the death penalty, especially if they brought along outsiders.</string>

They come in two sexes, male and female, and give birth to live young. They are bipedal beings with a bilateral symmetry, having a front and a back end, as well as an upside and downside. Their bodies are comprised of a torso with a head and four limbs attached to it. The upper limbs, or arms, end in hands which had five fingers each; the lower ones, called legs, end in feet. The human fingers have multiple points of articulation, and one of them is an opposable thumb that allowed for fine manipulation. Finally, they have one head perched atop their torso. Many other species, including twi\'leks, mon calamari, or zabraks, are referred to as "humanoids" because of their structural resemblance to humans.</string>
    <string name="human_info2">Humans can occupy a variety of employs, from politicians to bounty hunters, swoop racers, smugglers, or even a farmer.

They have glossy, usually brown flesh. Their reflexes and coordination are somewhat slower than that of average humanoids.\n"   " In addition to allowing them to speak their unique stereophonic language, the Ithorians\' four throats also have the ability to violently expel air, resulting in a deafening and potentially concussive scream. Despite this fact, most Ithorians go their entire lives without ever resorting to violence, and so the ability remained relatively ambiguous.</string>
    <string name="ithorian_info2">Ithorians worship the "Mother Jungle," a spiritual entity embodying the lush, tropical ecology of their world, Ithor. They are generally devoted environmentalists, staunch herbivores, and complete pacifists, devoting much time to contemplating their ecology, studying plants and their uses and the overall respecting of all living things. Most Ithorians never set foot on their own planet, instead living in floating cities above their world called herdships. Only three of their continents have been explored and harvested, the other two never having been touched by Ithorian hands. They demonstrate extreme belief in the protection and sustaining of their environment as dictated by their "Law of Life."</string>

    <string name="jawa_example">Jawa Example</string>
    <string name="jawa_info1">Jawas are easily identifiable by their traditional brown hooded robes, though it is not unheard of for them to wear other colors. Other notable features included their glowing yellow eyes, small stature and high pitched, quickly spoken language called Jawaese. Underneath their robes, jawas appear to be gaunt, rodent-like creatures, with shrunken faces and yellow eyes.</string>
    <string name="jawa_info2">Jawas are a communal, compulsive scavenger species who spend most of their life devoted to scavenging the deserts of Tatooine in search of any scrap metal, droid or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star travel and technological advancement. Most non-jawas regard the jawas as scavengers and thieves, a description that most jawas actually find pleasing.\n"   " The jawa\'s unofficial motto is not to look for uses in a salvaged item, but rather to imagine someone else who might find a use for it. This is evidenced in their endless search for wares with which to trade with almost any being jawas encounter. They have a kind of instinctive feel for machinery and electronics, notorious for knowing how to get a piece of equipment functioning just well enough to sell.</string>
    <string name="jawa_info3">Jawa names are quickly spoken, complex, and often misunderstood. Jawas who spend the majority of their time around other species respond well to nicknames. Male and female names do not significantly deviate. Surnames are clan based.</string>

An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerge from their egg as a tadpole that develops arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs are weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood.</string>

They possess distinctive faces: large, round, multifaceted eyes; tapir-like snouts; and a pair of saucer-shaped antennae on their heads, which served to detect vibrations. The flexible snouts augmented the rodians\' finely tuned olfactory senses, collecting and filtering the air. Their characteristically large eyes indicated a primarily nocturnal ancestry and were capable of seeing into the infrared part of the spectrum. Due to their love of fighting and active lifestyles, most rodians kept in good condition, normally lean and wiry; however, some wealthy rodians became complacent and obese.</string>
    <string name="rodian_info2">Rodian culture is obsessed with violence and death, due to behaviors and practices that are ingrained since their earliest ancestry. Their densely packed jungle homeworld is ill-suited for agriculture, requiring rodians to compete with vicious predators for most of their food, some of which can wipe out entire rodian villages. As the rodians developed cunning hunting tactics to survive, the hunt became central to their culture. Eventually, having driven most of the other predators on the planet to near extinction, they began to hunt each other in various wars and gladiatorial contests.</string>

    <string name="sith_pureblood_info2">Sith culture is a rigid and stratified caste-based society. For the sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Though they are in an almost constant state of war, their civilization is quite sophisticated; they see these acts not as cruel or barbaric, but simply basic aspects of existence. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society.</string>
    <string name="sith_pureblood_info3">Sith pureblood names are not conventional. They are often named for virtues in the Sith tongue. Sith rarely share surnames, since they do not value family ties. When a sith pureblood achieves a success or victory, they often change their name to match their perceived newfound status. Since Force-sensitivity is common in sith purebloods, and their culture is built around strength, most sith are called simply "My Lord," or some other epithet, by their underlings.</string>

    <string name="trandoshan_info1">Trandoshans are a large, bipedal sentient species, with scaly skin which was shed roughly once every standard year and was thought to be very durable. Cold-blooded reptiles, trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a trandoshan\'s finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward.</string>
    <string name="trandoshan_info2">Trandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper, whom they would appease through acts which increased their Jagannath points. This is done by living a lifestyle which was, by non-trandoshan standards, overtly aggressive, leading many trandoshans to become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers. Trandoshans especially prize wookiee pelts, which consequently play a large part in earning Jagannath points-capturing the pelts of particularly infamous wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in Jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one\'s Jagganath points-effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper. They could, however, win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed their score.</string>
    <string name="trandoshan_info3">Trandoshan names are quite harsh and contain a lot of elongated sounds, as well as a lot of s\'s. Differences between male and female names are often very subtle, but there is a higher chance for female names to contain softer sounds.</string>

    <string name="tusken_info2">Tuskens are a primative, tribal race, mostly living in small clans scattered throughout Tatooine\'s deserts. Due to the harsh and unforgiving desert environment, Tusken clans are often xenophobic and territorial, but it is not unknown for them to adopt members of other species into the clan. They believe that all water is sacred and promised to them alone, and are infamous among the other residents of Tatooine for raiding and pillaging settlements and farms.\n"   " Tusken clans are usually very stratified, with males as hunters and warriors, while females and children maintain the camp. Tusken warriors hold their bond with their gaderffii weapons and Bantha mounts as sacred, and will choose death before relinquishing either.</string>

    <string name="twilek_example">Twi\'lek Example</string>
    <string name="twilek_info1">Twi\'leks are usually thin, although corpulent individuals were known to exist. Twi\'leks are omnivores; this diet is essential given that food is scarce on their homeworld, Ryloth. Twi\'leks possess multiple stomachs, an unusual trait that enables them to eat almost any food. When traveling off their homeworld, twi\'leks rarely refuse food, which frequently leads to obesity among starfarers. Twi\'lek society also considers obesity as a sign of influence and success.</string>
    <string name="twilek_info2">The natural grace and exotic beauty of the female twi\'leks make them a popular target among slave traders. Slavery is the main currency of Ryloth. Some see it as a chance to make money by kidnapping or selling orphaned children, while others see slavery as a way of saving children from growing up in Ryloth\'s harsh environment. A number of twi\'leks believe that slavery is an efficient way to proliferate their species and preserve their culture, as the twi\'leks lack their own means of inter-planetary travel. Regardless of how it came about, many twi\'leks live as slaves or entertainers and are considered status symbols, especially the females of rarer skin hues. Twi\'leks that manage to escape from captivity usually turned to a life of thievery or prostitution, with both genders making use of their powers of seduction.</string>
    <string name="twilek_info3">Twi\'lek names combine their first name and a clan name into a single name, rather than having a separate surname.</string>

    <string name="weequay_info1">Weequays are humanoids with thick, leathery skin that ranges in color from tan to dark brown. Their faces are lipless, with a frill along each of their jowls.</string>
    <string name="weequay_info2">Weequays have the ability to communicate with members of their own clan through smell by exuding complex pheromones. This pheromonal language can not be understood by any other species, or even by Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses can even tell that two Weequay are communicating. Since each Weequay\'s pheromones are unique, Weequay have no need for a name within their clan. As a result, speech is only a secondary form of communication for Weequay, and they seldom speak a whole sentence, resulting in Humans mistakenly believing the species to be unintelligent.\n"   " Male Weequay often tie their hair into a long braid each year spent away from their homeworld as a tribute to their home. When they returned, they shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutts were often very close to their homeworld, and would only have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually bald, and did not follow this tradition.</string>
    <string name="weequay_info3">Only Weequay who have to live among other clans, or among non-Weequay, take a personal name. Even then, some are simply referred to as "Weequay". In Weequay culture, individual identity is much less important than the clan. As long as the clan survives, a single Weequay is expendable. This results in a sometimes brutal culture.</string>

    <string name="wookie_info1">Wookiees are a tall species of furry giants from the planet Kashyyyk, who can grow to a height of over eight feet. They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably came in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species has two sexes, female and male. The latter grows long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye colors are usually blue, green, yellow, golden, brown, or red.</string>
    <string name="wookie_info2">Wookiees greatly value honor and loyalty. Therefore, their notion of "family" encompassed much more than just blood ties. A part of that most sacred tradition was the social institution of life debt: when a wookiee\'s life was saved by someone else, regardless of the species, they would frequently devote themselves to a lifetime of service to their savior and their family. Through the mechanism of the life debt, the People of the Trees used to develop unbreakable bonds with their boon companions and true friends, forming a "honor family."</string>
    <string name="wookie_info3">Wookiee names are diverse; some names are simple and short while others are long and complicated. The majority of names often have softer big sounds and more melodic tones to them. Since offworlders have trouble using wookiees\' real names, they often adopt simpler nicknames to go by.</string>

    <string name="zabrak_example">Zabrak Example</string>
    <string name="zabrak_info1">Zabrak are near-human, but have a number of significant physical characteristics that set them apart from baseline Humanity. The most striking of these are a series of vestigial horns that crown the heads of both males and females. These horns grow at puberty in varying patterns and signified that their rite of passage is drawing near.\n"   " In addition to their horns, another of the traits that make zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial tattoos, which are made up of thin lines received during their rite of passage. These could symbolize many things, including but not limited to family lineage, place of birth, or even a design that reflected their individual personalities.\n"   " Lastly, zabraks possess a second heart.</string>
    <string name="zabrak_info2">Zabrak are often seen by most other species as being single-minded, an observation that is not terribly incorrect. This single-minded determination comes from the fact that they are a species with a strong sense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able to accomplish any task that they set out to do. However, this does not lead a zabrak to develop a sense of prideful superiority towards others. Though it is not uncommon to see competition between colonies, this is not seen as a negative. The zabraks believe that the various experiences of the different colonies only serve to add to the species\' overall value throughout the galaxy.</string>
    <string name="zabrak_info3">Zabrak names are usually derived from the animals living on their planet. Zabraks don\'t use surnames.</string>

In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to speeders and spaceships.\n"    "For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a stronghold or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&amp;D present.\n\n<font size="20"><b>Variant: Starting Wealth by Class</b></font></string>
    <string name="equipment_info_wealth2">Credits come in a variety of denominations: from a single chit to cards loaded with incredible value. While the Republic and Empire have their own currencies, in most worlds they can be used interchangeably.\n"    "With ten credits, a character can buy a power cell, a stylus, or a glowrod. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn ten credits a day. The credit is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the chit itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of credits, the transactions don\'t usually involve the exchange of individual chits. Rather, the credit is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in credit cards, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\n"    " A standard chit weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty chits weigh a pound.</string>

For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from basic combat suits to heavy battle armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.\n"   " The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in the worlds of Star Wars. </string>
    <string name="equipment_info_armors_and_shields2">Anyone can put on a suit of armor or wield a shield. Only those proficient in the armor\'s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor or wield a shield that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can\'t force- or tech-cast.\n"   " If you have proficiency in armor, you have proficiency in the appropriate shield as well. </string>
    <string name="equipment_info_armors_and_shields4">Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor\n(and shield) you wear determines your armor class\n(AC).</string>
    <string name="equipment_info_armors_and_shields3"><font size="20"><b>VARIANT: EQUIPMENT SIZES</b></font> \nIn most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly wookiee won\'t fit in a jawa\'s combat suit, and an ugnaught would be swallowed up in a gamorrean\'s hooded cloak.\n"   " The GM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard\'s uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.\n"   " Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armormech, synthweaver, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The GM can either roll 1d4x10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required. </string>
    <string name="equipment_info_armors_and_shields5"><font face="sans-serif">Many armors and shield have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Armor table.\n</font>

    <string name="equipment_info_weapons1"><font size="26">Weapons</font><font face="sans-serif">\nYour class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class\'s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a vibroweapon or a blaster, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring. The Weapons tables show the most common weapons used in the worlds of <i>Star Wars</i>, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as a blaster, lightweapon, or vibroweapon. A vibroweapon or lightweapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a blaster is used to attack a target at a distance. Lightweapons are generally used in melee, but due to their nature require separate proficiency.</font></string>
    <string name="equipment_info_weapons2">Your species, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons, which are commonly seen in the hands of the unspecialized, with proficiency. Martial weapons, such as vibroswords or sniper rifles, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</string>
    <string name="equipment_info_weapons3">Sometimes characters don\'t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead jawa.\n"   " In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. At the GM\'s discretion, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.\n"   " An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 kinetic damage. If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage.

Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon\'s normal damage. Before you use this property, you can declare one creature that would be affected by it. If the creature fails its save, in addition to the weapon\'s normal damage, it is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\ndexterity</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nA weapon with this property requires more skill to control. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Dexterity requirement.\n</font>

Make an attack roll against the initial target. If the attack hits, there is a creature within 15 feet of that creature and directly behind it, and the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it also takes normal weapon damage. Alternatively, you can use this property to fire at a creature through partial cover. When you do so, you reduce the target\'s cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to onequarter), rather than targeting a second creature.\n</font>

You can\'t attack a target beyond the weapon\'s long range.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\nrapid</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nWhen you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead unload on a single target, consuming ammunition equal to the rapid number. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, roll the weapon\'s damage dice twice and add them together, adding relevant modifiers as normal and subjecting the target to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.\n</font>

    <string name="equipment_info_tools"><font face="sans-serif">A tool helps you to do something you couldn\'t otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, pick a lock, or slice into a computer. Your species, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. Like skills, proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it. Unlike skills, you must have your tools present in order to make an ability check with them.\n"   " The table shows examples of some of the most common types of tools. Each tool falls under one of four categories: artisan\'s implements, gaming sets, musical instruments, or specialist\'s kits. Each tool requires a separate proficiency.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\nartisan\'s implements</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nArtisan\'s implements are predominantly designed for building and crafting things of permanent nature. Each set of implements focuses on a specific craft.\n"   " <b>Armormech\'s Implements:</b> Armormech\'s implements are for crafting and repairing armor and shields.\n"   " <b>Armstech\'s Implements:</b> Armstech\'s implements are for crafting and repairing blasters and vibroweapons.\n"   " <b>Artificer\'s Implements:</b> Artificer\'s implements are for creating lightweapons.\n"   " <b>Astrotech\'s Implements:</b> Astrotech\'s implements are for crafting and modifying droids.\n"   " <b>Biotech\'s Implements:</b> Biotech\'s implements are used to create cybernetic augmentations.\n"   " <b>Cybertech\'s Implements:</b> Cybertech\'s implements are used for crafting and modifying wristpads.\n"   " <b>Gadgeteer\'s Implements:</b> Gadgeteer\'s implements are used for crafting many types of adventuring gear, such as jet packs or friction-grip gear.\n"   " <b>Tinker\'s Implements:</b> Tinker\'s implements are general use tools that can craft small and versatile trinkets.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\ngaming sets</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nThis item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and/or decks of cards. A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\nmusical instruments</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nSeveral of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. Musical instruments can often be used in place of—or in addition to—a performance.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\nspecialist\'s kits</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nLike artisan\'s implements, specialist\'s kits are need to pursue a craft or trade. Some specialist\'s kits are used to craft items that are impermanent, such as grenades, medpacs, or poisons while other tools are used to achieve a specific purpose, such as picking locks or creating a disguise. \n"   " <b>Biochemist\'s Kit:</b> Biochemist\'s kits are used to create and enhance medpacs and other healing implements. \n"   " <b>Chef\'s Kit:</b> Chef\'s kits are used to prepare food and identify food that might be spoiled or tampered with. \n"   " <b>Demolitions Kit:</b> Demolitions kits are used to create, enhance, and disarm explosives. \n"   " <b>Disguise Kit:</b> Disguise kits are used to modify a creature\'s appearance, to hide their appearance or to mimic the appearance of others. \n"   " <b>Forgery Kit:</b> Forgery kits create false document and certifications, both physical and digital. \n"   " <b>Mechanic\'s Kit:</b> Mechanic\'s kits are used to craft and repair vehicles and starships. \n"   " <b>Poisoner\'s Kit:</b> Poisoner\'s kits are designed to create and identify poisons. \n"   " <b>Security Kit:</b> Security kits are used to bypass physical locks. \n"   " <b>Slicer\'s Kit:</b> Slicer\'s kits can bypass computerized defenses and locks. \n"   " <b>Trapper\'s Kit:</b> Trapper\'s kits can create, disarm, and disassemble traps.</font></string>
    <!--Info Expenses-->
    <string name="equipment_info_expenses1"><font size="26">Expenses</font><font face="sans-serif">\nWhen not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.</font></string>
    <string name="equipment_info_expenses2"><font size="20">wretched</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nYou live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\nsqualid</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nYou live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed diseased.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\npoor</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nA poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a cantina. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\nmodest</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nA modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don\'t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, and the like.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\ncomfortable</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nChoosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small domicile in a middleclass neighborhood or in a private room at a fine establishment. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\nwealthy</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nChoosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\n</font>
        <font size="20">\naristocratic</font> <font face="sans-serif">\nYou live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of the affluent. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</font></string>
    <string name="equipment_info_expenses3">The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night\'s lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.</string>
    <string name="equipment_info_expenses4"><font size="22"><b>Self-Sufficiency</b></font>\nThe expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter assume that you are spending your time between adventures in cities, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford— paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to repair your equipment, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\n"   " Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn\'t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, as described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.</string>
    <string name="equipment_info_expenses5">Adventurers can pay non-player characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.\n"   " Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a fighter might commission an armstech to craft a special vibroblade, while a scholar might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming meeting with a senator.\n"   " Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a trandoshan army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the facilities clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.</string>
